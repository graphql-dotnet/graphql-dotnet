## Source:
https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet/issues/1211

A simple sample project featuring a basic car dealership managed with SQLite. It demonstrates the use of DataLoader accessed through `IDataLoaderContextAccessor` to load salespeople by name, including their assigned cars in a subgraph, and exposes this data as a GraphQL server using the `GraphQL.Server.All` package with the Altair UI. The project highlights the practical use of `IDataLoaderContextAccessor` for managing DataLoader instances.```
