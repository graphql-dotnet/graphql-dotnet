# Relay

The core project provides a few classes to help implement Facebook's [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/).
You can find more types and helpers in the [GraphQL.NET Relay project](https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/relay).
Also see the specification for the GraphQL "Connections" pattern [here](https://relay.dev/graphql/connections.htm).

See this blog [post](https://fiyazhasan.me/graphql-with-net-core-part-xii-relay/) for a complete example of using Relay with GraphQL.
