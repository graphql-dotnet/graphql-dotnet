# GQL015: Can't infer a Field name from expression

|                        | Value  |
| ---------------------- | ------ |
| **Rule ID**            | GQL015 |
| **Category**           | Usage  |
| **Default severity**   | Error  |
| **Enabled by default** | Yes    |
| **Code fix provided**  | No     |
| **Introduced in**      | v7.9   |

## Cause

This rule triggers when field defined with expression which is not a simple
member access expression.

## Rule description

When defining fields with expression, the GraphQL.NET tries to infer the field
name from the expression. This is only possible when the expression is a simple
member access expression like field or property. For example

```c#
p => p.FirstName
```

## How to fix violations

Use an overload that accepts a `name` parameter to define the field name
explicitly.

## Example of a violation

```c#
public class PersonGraphType : ObjectGraphType<Person>
{
    public PersonGraphType()
    {
        Field(p => $"{p.FirstName} {p.LastName}");
    }
}

public class Person
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
}
```

## Example of how to fix

Define the field name explicitly

```c#
public class PersonGraphType : ObjectGraphType<Person>
{
    public PersonGraphType()
    {
        Field("FullName", p => $"{p.FirstName} {p.LastName}");
    }
}

public class Person
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
}
```

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to
your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable GQL015
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore GQL015
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none`
in the
[configuration file](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/configuration-files).

```ini
[*.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.GQL015.severity = none
```
