# GQL010: Can not resolve input source type constructor

|                        | Value  |
| ---------------------- | ------ |
| **Rule ID**            | GQL010 |
| **Category**           | Usage  |
| **Default severity**   | ERROR  |
| **Enabled by default** | Yes    |
| **Code fix provided**  | No     |
| **Introduced in**      | v8.0   |

## Cause

This rule triggers when the type `TSourceType` used in the
`InputObjectGraphType<TSourceType>` or `AutoRegisteringInputObjectGraphType<TSourceType>` can't be constructed during the input
parsing. If the type or one of its base types override the `ParseDictionary`
method the validation is skipped.

## Rule description

The `TSourceType` should be a non-abstract `class`, `struct` or `record` and
satisfy one of the following requirements:

- Have an implicit default constructor
- Have a public parameterless constructor
- Have a singular public parameterized constructor
- Have multiple public parameterized constructors and one and only one of them
  is annotated with `GraphQLConstructorAttribute`

## How to fix violations

Follow the rules described in the [Rule description](#rule-description) section.

## Example of a violation

```c#
// no public constructor
public class MyInput1
{
    internal MyInput1(string name, int age)
    {
        Name = name;
        Age = age;
    }

    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

// multiple public parametrized constructors
public class MyInput2
{
    public MyInput2(string name)
    {
        Name = name;
    }

    public MyInput2(int age)
    {
        Age = age;
    }

    public string? Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}
```

## Example of how to fix

```c#
// make the constructor public
public class MyInput1
{
    public MyInput(string name, int age)
    {
        Name = name;
        Age = age;
    }

    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

// annotate one of the constructors with a GraphQLConstructorAttribute
public class MyInput2
{
    [GraphQLConstructor]
    public MyInput2(string name)
    {
        Name = name;
    }

    public MyInput2(int age)
    {
        Age = age;
    }

    public string? Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}
```

## Configure the analyzer

If the `ParseDictionary` method of the analyzed type or any of its base types is
overridden, the type analysis is skipped. However, you can manually force the
analysis by specifying a comma-delimited list of full type names in the
`.editorconfig` file using the
`dotnet_diagnostic.input_graph_type_analyzer.force_types_analysis` configuration
key.

For instance, to enforce the analysis check for both
`MyServer.BaseInputObjectGraphType` and `MyServer.BaseInputObjectGraphType2`,
include the following configuration in your `.editorconfig` file:

```ini
dotnet_diagnostic.input_graph_type_analyzer.force_types_analysis = MyServer.BaseInputObjectGraphType,MyServer.BaseInputObjectGraphType2
```

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to
your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable GQL010
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore GQL010
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none`
in the
[configuration file](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/configuration-files).

```ini
[*.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.GQL010.severity = none
```
