# GQL016: Require parameterless constructor

|                        | Value  |
| ---------------------- | ------ |
| **Rule ID**            | GQL016 |
| **Category**           | Usage  |
| **Default severity**   | Error  |
| **Enabled by default** | Yes    |
| **Code fix provided**  | No     |
| **Introduced in**      | v8.0   |

## Cause

This rule is triggered when a generic argument type or a type implementing an
interface is required to have a public parameterless constructor but does not
have one.

## Rule description

Certain APIs provided by the GraphQL.NET library require that types implementing
an interface or passed as a generic argument must have a parameterless
constructor. This rule ensures compliance by verifying the presence of such a
constructor and reporting an error if the type does not meet this requirement.

## How to fix violations

Define parameterless constructor on the type or remove all the constructors.

## Example of a violation

```c#
public class MyComplexityAnalyzer : IFieldComplexityAnalyzer
{
    public MyComplexityAnalyzer(ILogger<MyComplexityAnalyzer> logger)
    {
    }

    public FieldComplexityResult Analyze(FieldImpactContext context)
    {
        return new FieldComplexityResult(10, 1);
    }
}
```

## Example of how to fix

Define parameterless constructor on the type or remove all the constructors.

```c#
public class MyComplexityAnalyzer : IFieldComplexityAnalyzer
{
    public FieldComplexityResult Analyze(FieldImpactContext context)
    {
        return new FieldComplexityResult(10, 1);
    }
}
```

## Suppress a warning

If you just want to suppress a single violation, add preprocessor directives to
your source file to disable and then re-enable the rule.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable GQL016
// The code that's violating the rule is on this line.
#pragma warning restore GQL016
```

To disable the rule for a file, folder, or project, set its severity to `none`
in the
[configuration file](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/configuration-files).

```ini
[*.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.GQL016.severity = none
```
