## Breaking Changes

### UnhandledExceptionDelegate

`ExecutionOptions.UnhandledExceptionDelegate` and `IExecutionContext.UnhandledExceptionDelegate`
properties type was changed from `Action<UnhandledExceptionContext>` to `Func<UnhandledExceptionContext, Task>`
so now you may use async/await for exception handling. In this regard, some methods in `ExecutionStrategy` were
renamed to have `Async` suffix.

### Redesign of [IDocumentCache](https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet/blob/develop/src/GraphQL/Caching/IDocumentCache.cs).

1. Use async methods to get or set a cache.
2. Cache items cannot be removed anymore.
