# v0.11.0 Upgrade Guide

## Language Types Namespace Change

The language AST types have been moved from `GraphQL.Language` to `GraphQL.Language.AST`.

## New Parser
This release adds a new lexer and parser for the GraphQL language.  The `AntlrDocumentBuilder` is now deprecated in favor of the `GraphQLDocumentBuilder`.  This new lexer and parser are written in C# and have no other dependencies.  It is also slightly faster than the `AntlrDocumentBuilder`.

The new parser can be found at [graphql-dotnet/parser](http://github.com/graphql-dotnet/parser).

The `AntlrDocumentBuilder` will be removed in the next major release.
