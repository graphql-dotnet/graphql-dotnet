This is an implementation of [Facebook's GraphQL](https://github.com/facebook/graphql) in .NET.

Now the [specification](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec) is being developed by the
[GraphQL Foundation](https://foundation.graphql.org/).

This project uses a [lexer/parser](http://github.com/graphql-dotnet/parser) originally written
by [Marek Magdziak](https://github.com/mkmarek) and released with a MIT license. Thank you Marek!

Provides the following packages:

You can get all preview versions from [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/orgs/graphql-dotnet/packages?repo_name=graphql-dotnet).
Note that GitHub requires authentication to consume the feed. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/packages/publishing-and-managing-packages/about-github-packages#authenticating-to-github-packages).

## Documentation

1. http://graphql-dotnet.github.io - documentation site that is built from the [docs](/docs2/site/) folder in the `master` branch.
2. https://graphql.org/learn - learn about GraphQL, how it works, and how to use it.

## Debugging

All packages generated from this repository come with embedded pdb and support [Source Link](https://github.com/dotnet/sourcelink).
If you are having difficulty understanding how the code works or have encountered an error, then it is just enough to enable
Source Link in your IDE settings. Then you can debug GraphQL.NET source code as if it were part of your project.

## Installation

#### 1. GraphQL.NET engine

This is the main package, the heart of the repository in which you can find all the necessary classes
for GraphQL request processing.

```
> dotnet add package GraphQL
```

#### 2. Serialization

For serialized results, you'll need an `IGraphQLSerializer` implementation.
We provide several serializers (or you can bring your own).

```
> dotnet add package GraphQL.SystemTextJson
> dotnet add package GraphQL.NewtonsoftJson
```

> *Note: You can use `GraphQL.NewtonsoftJson` with .NET Core 3+, just be aware it lacks async writing 
> capabilities so writing to an ASP.NET Core 3.0 `HttpResponse.Body` will require you to set 
> `AllowSynchronousIO` to `true` as per [this announcement](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/342);
> which isn't recommended.*

#### 3. Document Caching

The recommended way to setup caching layer (for caching of parsed GraphQL documents) is to
inherit from `IConfigureExecution` interface and register your class as its implementation.
We provide in-memory implementation on top of `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory` package.

```
> dotnet add package GraphQL.MemoryCache
```

For more information see [Document Caching](https://graphql-dotnet.github.io/docs/guides/document-caching).

#### 4. DataLoader

DataLoader is a generic utility to be used as part of your application's data fetching layer
to provide a simplified and consistent API over various remote data sources such as databases
or web services via batching and caching.

```
> dotnet add package GraphQL.DataLoader
```

For more information see [DataLoader](https://graphql-dotnet.github.io/docs/guides/dataloader).

> *Note: Prior to version 4, the contents of this package was part of the main GraphQL.NET package.*

#### 5. Subscriptions

`DocumentExecuter` can handle subscriptions as well as queries and mutations.
For more information see [Subscriptions](https://graphql-dotnet.github.io/docs/getting-started/subscriptions).

#### 6. Advanced Dependency Injection

Also we provide some extra classes for advanced dependency injection usage on top of
`Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions` package.

```
> dotnet add package GraphQL.MicrosoftDI
```

For more information see [Thread safety with scoped services](https://graphql-dotnet.github.io/docs/getting-started/dependency-injection#thread-safety-with-scoped-services).

## Examples

https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/examples

You can also try an example of GraphQL demo server inside this repo - [GraphQL.Harness](src/GraphQL.Harness/GraphQL.Harness.csproj).
It supports the popular IDEs for managing GraphQL requests and exploring GraphQL schema:
- [Altair](https://github.com/imolorhe/altair)
- [Firecamp](https://firecamp.io/graphql/)
- [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql)
- [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-playground)
- [Voyager](https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-voyager)

## Ahead-of-time compilation

GraphQL.NET supports ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation for execution of code-first schemas with .NET 7. This allows
for use within iOS and Android apps, as well as other environments where such features as JIT compilation or
dynamic code generation are not available. It may be necessary to explicitly instruct the AOT compiler
to include the .NET types necessary for your schema to operate correctly. Of particular note, your query,
mutation and subscription types' constructors may be trimmed; register them in your DI engine to prevent this.
Also, `Field(x => x.MyField)` for enumeration values will require manually adding a mapping reference via
`RegisterTypeMapping<MyEnum, EnumerationGraphType<MyEnum>>()`. Please see the `GraphQL.AotCompilationSample` for a simple
demonstration of AOT compilation. Schema-first and type-first schemas have additional limtations and configuration requirements.
AOT compilation has not been tested with frameworks other than .NET 7 on Windows and Linux (e.g. Xamarin).

## Training

* [API Development in .NET with GraphQL](https://www.lynda.com/NET-tutorials/API-Development-NET-GraphQL/664823-2.html) - [Glenn Block](https://twitter.com/gblock) demonstrates how to use the GraphQL.NET framework to build a fully functional GraphQL endpoint.

* [0.8.0](https://graphql-dotnet.github.io/docs/migrations/v0_8_0)

## Basic Usage

Define your schema with a top level query object then execute that query.

Fully-featured examples can be found [here](https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/examples).

### Hello World

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using GraphQL;
using GraphQL.Types;
using GraphQL.SystemTextJson; // First add PackageReference to GraphQL.SystemTextJson

var schema = Schema.For(@"
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
");

var root = new { Hello = "Hello World!" };
var json = await schema.ExecuteAsync(_ =>
{
  _.Query = "{ hello }";
  _.Root = root;
});

Console.WriteLine(json);
```

### Schema First Approach

This example uses the [GraphQL schema language](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#type-language).
See the [documentation](https://graphql-dotnet.github.io/docs/getting-started/introduction) for
more examples and information.

```csharp
public class Droid
{
  public string Id { get; set; }
  public string Name { get; set; }
}

public class Query
{
  [GraphQLMetadata("droid")]
  public Droid GetDroid()
  {
    return new Droid { Id = "123", Name = "R2-D2" };
  }
}

var schema = Schema.For(@"
  type Droid {
    id: ID
    name: String
  }

  type Query {
    droid: Droid
  }
", _ => {
    _.Types.Include<Query>();
});

var json = await schema.ExecuteAsync(_ =>
{
  _.Query = "{ droid { id name } }";
});
```

### Parameters

```csharp
public class Droid
{
  public string Id { get; set; }
  public string Name { get; set; }
}

public class Query
{
  private List<Droid> _droids = new List<Droid>
  {
    new Droid { Id = "123", Name = "R2-D2" }
  };

  [GraphQLMetadata("droid")]
  public Droid GetDroid(string id)
  {
    return _droids.FirstOrDefault(x => x.Id == id);
  }
}

var schema = Schema.For(@"
  type Droid {
    id: ID
    name: String
  }

  type Query {
    droid(id: ID): Droid
  }
", _ => {
    _.Types.Include<Query>();
});

var json = await schema.ExecuteAsync(_ =>
{
  _.Query = $"{{ droid(id: \"123\") {{ id name }} }}";
});
```

with some additional experimental introspection [extensions](https://graphql-dotnet.github.io/docs/getting-started/directives#directives-and-introspection).

## Publishing NuGet packages

The package publishing process is automated with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

After your PR is merged into `master` or `develop`, preview packages are published to [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/orgs/graphql-dotnet/packages?repo_name=graphql-dotnet).

Stable versions of packages are published to NuGet when a [release](https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet/releases) is created.
