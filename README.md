This is an implementation of [Facebook's GraphQL](https://github.com/facebook/graphql) in .NET.

Now the [specification](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec) is being developed by the
[GraphQL Foundation](https://foundation.graphql.org/).

This project uses a [lexer/parser](http://github.com/graphql-dotnet/parser) originally written
by [Marek Magdziak](https://github.com/mkmarek) and released with a MIT license. Thank you Marek!

## Documentation

http://graphql-dotnet.github.io

This site is in sync with `master` branch.

## Installation

You can install the latest stable version via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GraphQL/).
```
> dotnet add package GraphQL
```

For serialized results, you'll need an `IDocumentWriter` implementation.
We support several serializers (or you can bring your own):

| Package | Downloads | Nuget Latest |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| GraphQL.SystemTextJson | [![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/GraphQL.SystemTextJson)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GraphQL.SystemTextJson) | [![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/GraphQL.SystemTextJson)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GraphQL.SystemTextJson) |
| GraphQL.NewtonsoftJson | [![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/GraphQL.NewtonsoftJson)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GraphQL.NewtonsoftJson) | [![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/GraphQL.NewtonsoftJson)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GraphQL.NewtonsoftJson) |

```
> dotnet add package GraphQL.SystemTextJson
> dotnet add package GraphQL.NewtonsoftJson
```
> *Note: You can use `GraphQL.NewtonsoftJson` with .NET Core 3+, just be aware it lacks async writing 
> capabilities so writing to an ASP.NET Core 3.0 `HttpResponse.Body` will require you to set 
> `AllowSynchronousIO` to `true` as per [this announcement](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/342);
> which isn't recommended.*

You can get all preview versions from [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/orgs/graphql-dotnet/packages?repo_name=graphql-dotnet).
Note that GitHub requires authentication to consume the feed.  See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/packages/publishing-and-managing-packages/about-github-packages#authenticating-to-github-packages).

## Examples

https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/examples

You can also try an example of GraphQL demo server inside this repo - [GraphQL.Harness](src/GraphQL.Harness/GraphQL.Harness.csproj).
It supports the popular IDEs for managing GraphQL requests and exploring GraphQL schema:
- [Altair](https://github.com/imolorhe/altair)
- [Firecamp](https://firecamp.io/graphql/)
- [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql)
- [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-playground)
- [Voyager](https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-voyager)

## Training

* [API Development in .NET with GraphQL](https://www.lynda.com/NET-tutorials/API-Development-NET-GraphQL/664823-2.html) - [Glenn Block](https://twitter.com/gblock) demonstrates how to use the GraphQL .NET framework to build a fully functional GraphQL endpoint.
* [Building GraphQL APIs with ASP.NET Core](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/building-graphql-apis-aspdotnet-core/table-of-contents) by [Roland Guijt](https://github.com/RolandGuijt)

## Upgrade Guides

You can see the changes in public APIs using [fuget.org](https://www.fuget.org/packages/GraphQL/3.0.0/lib/netstandard2.0/diff/2.4.0/).
 
* [2.4.0 to 3.0](https://graphql-dotnet.github.io/docs/migrations/migration3)
* [0.17.x to 2.x](https://graphql-dotnet.github.io/docs/migrations/migration2)
* [0.11.0](https://graphql-dotnet.github.io/docs/migrations/v0_11_0)
* [0.8.0](https://graphql-dotnet.github.io/docs/migrations/v0_8_0)

## Basic Usage

Define your schema with a top level query object then execute that query.

Fully-featured examples can be found [here](https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/examples).

### Hello World

```csharp
var schema = Schema.For(@"
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
");

var root = new { Hello = "Hello World!" };
var json = await schema.ExecuteAsync(_ =>
{
  _.Query = "{ hello }";
  _.Root = root;
});

Console.WriteLine(json);
```

### Schema First Approach

This example uses the [GraphQL schema language](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#type-language).
See the [documentation](https://graphql-dotnet.github.io/docs/getting-started/introduction) for
more examples and information.

```csharp
public class Droid
{
  public string Id { get; set; }
  public string Name { get; set; }
}

public class Query
{
  [GraphQLMetadata("droid")]
  public Droid GetDroid()
  {
    return new Droid { Id = "123", Name = "R2-D2" };
  }
}

var schema = Schema.For(@"
  type Droid {
    id: ID
    name: String
  }

  type Query {
    droid: Droid
  }
", _ => {
    _.Types.Include<Query>();
});

var json = await schema.ExecuteAsync(_ =>
{
  _.Query = "{ droid { id name } }";
});
```

### Parameters

```csharp
public class Droid
{
  public string Id { get; set; }
  public string Name { get; set; }
}

public class Query
{
  private List<Droid> _droids = new List<Droid>
  {
    new Droid { Id = "123", Name = "R2-D2" }
  };

  [GraphQLMetadata("droid")]
  public Droid GetDroid(string id)
  {
    return _droids.FirstOrDefault(x => x.Id == id);
  }
}

var schema = Schema.For(@"
  type Droid {
    id: ID
    name: String
  }

  type Query {
    droid(id: ID): Droid
  }
", _ => {
    _.Types.Include<Query>();
});

var json = await schema.ExecuteAsync(_ =>
{
  _.Query = $"{{ droid(id: \"123\") {{ id name }} }}";
});
```

## Roadmap

## Publishing NuGet packages

The package publishing process is automated with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

After your PR is merged into `master` or `develop`, preview packages are published to [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/orgs/graphql-dotnet/packages?repo_name=graphql-dotnet).

Stable versions of packages are published to NuGet when a [release](https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet/releases) is created.
